## When people discuss what the "best" programming language is, there's never a single answer. This is because many programming languages have many strengths and weaknesses.

## However, I became interested in finding out which is the fastest at writing/reading data to/from a file respectively. Some would argue that the choices I made for I/O in each language are not the most efficient. This claim is likely true, because I wrote this as a student with a minimal understanding of efficiency and streams.
