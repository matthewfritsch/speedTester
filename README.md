# The "speedTester" program(s)
### When people discuss what the "best" programming language is, there's never a single, definitive answer. This is because many programming languages have differing strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.

### However, I became interested in finding out which is the fastest at writing/reading data to/from a file respectively. Some would argue that the choices I made for I/O in each language are not the most efficient. This claim is likely true, because I wrote this as a student with a minimal understanding of efficiency and streams. Furthermore, the goal of this program is not to find what is the quickest execution for writing information to a file in any given language. The goal is to find how much of a time difference there is between languages when tasked with writing many single lines.
